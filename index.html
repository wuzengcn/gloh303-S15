# The scientific paper 

A well-written scientific paper explains 

- the scientist's .red[motivation] for doing an experiment, 

- the .red[experimental design and execution], and 

- the .red[meaning] of the results. 

Scientific papers are written in a style that is exceedingly .red[clear] and .red[concise]. 

Their purpose is to inform an audience of other scientists about an important issue and to document the particular approach they used to investigate that issue.

.green[The study assessed willingness to join and willingness to pay for health-insurance in Afghanistan and identified associated determinants.] .red[A household survey was conducted. Two health-insurance and two medicine-insurance packages were explained to respondents, who were then asked if they would be willing to join the packages and pay for them. The double-bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation method was used to elicit the maximum amount respondents would be willing to pay for the various benefit packages. Logistic and linear regression models were used to examine determinants of willingness to join and willingness to pay.] .purple[Most respondents had never heard of health insurance. And yet, when they were told about it, the vast majority of respondents said they would be willing to join one of the four benefit packages and pay for them, ranging from 70.7% for a medicine-only package that included only essential medicines, to 92.4% for a health-insurance package that would cover only primary and secondary care. The average willingness to pay cost was 1,236 (US`$`21.3), 1,512 (US`$`26.0), 778 (US`$`13.4) and 430 (US`$`7.4) Afghani per person, per year for the primary and secondary; comprehensive primary, secondary and some tertiary; all medicine; and essential medicine packages; respectively.] .blue[Key determinants of willingness to join, and to pay were similar, including the provinces where respondents were located, wealth status, health expenditures and some demographic characteristics.]

- This section discusses the results and conclusions of .red[previously published studies], to help explain why the current study is of scientific .red[interest].

- The Introduction is organized to move .red[from general information] to .red[specific information]. 

- The background must be summarized succinctly, but it should not be itemized. 

- Limit the introduction to studies that relate directly to the present study. 

- Emphasize your specific contribution to the topic.

- The last sentences of the introduction should be a statement of objectives and a statement of hypotheses.

# Introduction (example)

&gt; The .red[World] Health Organization defines .red[universal health coverage] as access to key promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative health interventions for all at an affordable cost, leading to equity in access to services

&gt; .red[Health insurance] has been used as a key mechanism to reduce out-of-pocket payments for healthcare services in many developing countries. 

&gt; The government of .red[Afghanistan] is committed to achieving .red[universal health coverage], providing health services to all citizens without imposing financial hardship on households.

&gt; Facing great financial constraints in providing healthcare services, the Afghan government is increasingly interested in exploring options for implementing a national .red[health-insurance program]. 

&gt;  With financial support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the MoPH initiated a health-insurance .red[feasibility study] to examine the readiness of Afghanistan to introduce health insurance program. 

&gt; .red[Willingness to join and willingness to pay] are two important concepts to understand potential demand for health insurance if health insurance were available. 

&gt; To better understand Afghans’ potential demand for health insurance, this study assesses willingness to join and willingness to pay for four hypothetical health- and medicine-insurance packages in eight provinces of Afghanistan.

# Methods 

The objective of the methods section is to describe exactly what you did, and how, in .red[sufficient detail] such that any average reader with the same resources at their disposal would be able to .red[reproduce] your study.

### Study design

&gt; The study used a .red[triplet-matched cluster randomized design] to evaluate the impact on health service delivery in a total of 30 districts from eight provinces. District-level data were collected and scores were assigned to districts for population health, socioeconomic conditions and health governance capacity. In most provinces, three districts at or near the provincial median index score in that province were selected and then randomly allocated among the three different groups: results-based financing, input-based financing or control.

---

### Methods (study subjects)

- Sampling 

&gt; The study was carried out through a household survey...  Sampling design within each province mirrored the .red[multi-stage process] used in the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey. 

- Sample size

&gt; We estimated a total sample size of .red[2,635 individuals] for the study, accounting for 10 % nonresponse and assuming a factor of two for the sampling effect due to the cluster random sampling, with a precision of 6 % of the standard deviation of the main outcome indicator (willingness to pay). 

- Source of data

&gt; The study was carried out through a household survey. 

---

# Methods (Instrument and measurements)

- Instruments 

&gt; A comprehensive quantitative questionnaire was designed

&gt; The questionnaire consisted of four major components: a willingness-to-pay module for designed health-insurance packages, demographic characteristics of households and household members, socioeconomic status and health status of respondents and their family members.

- Measurement

  - Health status: 

  &gt; Respondents were asked to rank their own health status from 1 to 10 (where 10 is healthiest). They were asked about the health status of their household members (all of them combined) using a .red[Likert scale], from very sick to very healthy. To simplify the analysis, we .red[converted] it to a dummy variable, with 1 being heathy or very healthy and 0 otherwise. 

  - Health expenditure
  
  &gt; The questionnaire also included detailed questions on health expenditures for inpatient and outpatient health services in all types of health facilities for the respondent and his/her households. For each type of service, respondents were asked how many times they had used the service in the past year and the cost of the last time they used the service...

# Data collection

&gt; Data collection .red[occurred] in April and May 2019 by experienced .red[teams] of enumerators (two males and two females for each team) accompanied by a supervisor. Three teams were assigned to Kabul province, and two teams were assigned to the other seven provinces to collect relevant data through .red[face-to-face interviews].

# Statistical analysis 

&gt; We used .red[univariate analysis] to examine demographic and economic characteristics, economic status, health status, and perceptions of health insurance. We then used .red[multivariate analysis] to assess willingness to join and the amount respondents would be willing to pay.

- logistic regression model 

  
`$$ln(\frac{p}{1-p}) = b_0 + B_1province + b_2age + b_3male + b_4\text{HH head}+b_5\text{HH size}+ b_6uneducated + \\ b_7occupied + b_8\text{self health} +b_9\text{health of HH} + b_{10}\text{heard of insurance} + \\ b_{11}\text{wealth index} + b_{12}\text{health expenditure + 1}$$`

# Results 

The aim of the results section is to describe what you observed, .red[without commentary or discussion].


You will .red[not present the raw data] that you collected, but rather you will .red[summarize] the data with .red[text, tables and/or figures].

Use the text of the paper to state the results of your study, then refer the reader to a table or figure where they can see the data for themselves.

If the paper is using a dataset for the analysis, generally, it starts with the descriptive analysis (univariate analysis), then bivariate analysis, and then multivariate analysis

# Presentation of findings

### Text 

- used when the results can be easily described in one or two lines 

### Tables 

- used for most important results, and on their own, sufficent to give readers a clear idea of findings 

### Figures 

- Used for complex findings that are not easer for interpretation

# Results examples 

### Willingness to join 

&gt; The study found that most respondents would join any of the four packages. Of the surveyed population, .red[92.4 % and 85.7 %] would join the I1 and I2 packages, respectively. Fewer respondents would join the more comprehensive health insurance packages, which include tertiary facilities. With respect to the medicine-only packages, .red[84.1 % and 70.7 %] would join the M1 and M2 packages, respectively. More respondents would join the package that includes all medications, not only essential ones.

# Results examples 

.red[Table 3] shows the determinants of willingness to join the health insurance packages. There were significant differences by province on willingness to join. In some provinces, respondents were significantly more likely to be willing to join compared to Kabul, in others significantly less likely. For example, respondents in Ghazni province were .red[eight times more likely] to be willing to join the package with primary and secondary facilities (I1), and seven times more likely to join the package including tertiary facilities (I2) than respondents in Kabul. .red[Men were much more likely] to be willing to join compared to women. Age appears to have a negative relationship with willingness to join—younger respondents were more likely to be willing to join compared to older respondents, and the effect was statistically significant for both health-insurance packages and the first medicine-only (M1) package.

This study was designed to assess whether Afghans would be willing to join health-insurance benefit packages and how much they would be willing to pay for them. .red[Overall, results show good potential for a health-insurance program in Afghanistan. Most encouraging are the attitudes of respondents toward health insurance. Although few respondents had heard of health insurance before the study, when the benefit packages were described, their responses were overwhelmingly positive.] These findings are consistent with the literature on willingness to pay for health insurance in other countries. For example, in a study conducted in Liberia that assessed willingness to pay for a drug revolving-fund and health-insurance program among 374 households, about 84 % of respondents were willing to join. Similarly, in a study in Namibia, 87 % of respondents were willing to join health insurance.

---

# Interpretation of findings 

&gt; We expected age to be positively associated with willingness to join and willingness to pay higher amounts, because older people have more health needs. .blue[However, results consistently showed a negative association instead (statistically significant for willingness to join for three of the packages, but not for the amount willing to pay)] .red[We thought this might be because the description of the packages, read to respondents during the interview, included free insurance to older people (ages 65 years or older), but the data did not support this expectation.] Similarly, we expected that older people would be more likely to have larger households and more pregnant women and infants at home (both would also receive health insurance free of charge), but the data did not support this. .red[Perhaps the negative association between age and willingness to join and pay has to do with health literacy. Studies show that younger people are more health literate than older ones [21], [22] and thus are more open to accepting new programs].

### Implications 

&gt; We realize that many factors affect willingness to pay. The multivariate analyses revealed significant differences between provinces in willingness to join and willingness to pay. Given the differences in demographic and economic characteristics of respondents from the different provinces, .red[these differences should be considered when insurance rates are calculated for coverage in the various provinces.] For example, we found that household wealth was associated with being willing to pay more for health insurance, as was household health expenditures. .red[This suggests the need to consider social inequalities in the design of the health-insurance program.]

]

.right-column[
&gt; The study provides useful information for the design of the Afghan national health insurance program, but it has some limitations: (1) Data collectors reported that some respondents’ interest and attention declined after the first 30–35 min of the interview. However, our experienced interviewers mitigated this. (2) Household earning and spending data were regarded as sensitive by some respondents, who were reluctant to share this information. That is why we used the poverty score to derive the wealth index, as a proxy for income. (3) Estimating health expenditures required respondents to provide expenditures information for last doctor visits or hospital admission and the number of outpatient visits and hospital admissions incurred for a year. .red[Recall bias was inevitable. However, we assume that the bias in reporting such expenditures was consistent across respondents in all provinces, so that health expenditures was still a useful variable to include in the multivariate analysis.] This was confirmed by the strong association we found in the data between health expenditures and willingness to join and pay for health insurance.

# Limitations (example)

&gt; .blue[Fourth, some costs were not fully captured in the model. For example, estimating indirect costs due to loss of income would benefit from a more accurate rate of long-term absenteeism and the cost of HCW replacement.] .green[In this study, these costs are not included because data on the rates of long-term absenteeism are lacking.] Additionally, the cost of presenteeism is not fully estimated. We assumed a 10% reduction in productivity among HCWs not infected (or not known to be infected) with SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, the costs due to burnout and mental health impacts in HCWs are not included. .red[Thus, the overall economic burden may be an underestimate.]

---
# Conclusions (summary of key findings and implications)

&gt; Respondents had very little knowledge of health insurance. Yet, when the concept was explained to them, most were willing to join and pay for a health-insurance package. Specific results varied by province. Individual province characteristics, such as average income, employment and education levels and utilization of health services must be considered in the design of the national health insurance program. Age and gender are also important determinants of willingness to join a health-insurance program, as men were more willing to join than women, and younger people were more willing to join than older people. These findings are also pertinent to developing and targeting the necessary marketing materials for the expected health insurance program pilot.
